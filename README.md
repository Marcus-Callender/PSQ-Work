Mime Time is a turn based stratagy game, the players take turns moving and attacking with there mimes.
I worked on the colision between the charicters, enviroments and weapons. As well as the charicter movment and camra movement.

Goodbye MoonMan is a game where the player build up power in the first stage then controls the moonmans movments while they
try to avoid obsticals and collect coins. If the player fails to reach the moon they can spend poins to upgrade there charicter.
I worked on the movement, speed control, poins system and upgrades.
